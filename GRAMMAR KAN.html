            <h2 class="section-heading">3. Subject-Verb Agreement</h2>

            <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">

                Subject-verb agreement is a fundamental grammar rule ensuring that the verb in a sentence corresponds correctly in number (singular or plural) with its subject. Errors in agreement can significantly impact your grammar score. A strong grasp of this concept demonstrates precision and control, which are highly valued by examiners. Even in complex sentences with intervening phrases, the verb must always agree with its true subject.

            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-sub-section-heading">3.1. Key Rules and Advanced Considerations:</h3>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Singular Subject, Singular Verb:</strong> A singular subject takes a singular verb (usually ending in -s in the present simple, or 'is', 'was', 'has').

                    <div class="example-box">The <span class="font-bold">report highlights</span> a growing concern regarding urban development. (Not 'report highlight')</div>

                    <div class="example-box">A <span class="font-bold">major challenge is</span> the lack of funding.</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Plural Subject, Plural Verb:</strong> A plural subject takes a plural verb (no -s in the present simple, or 'are', 'were', 'have').

                    <div class="example-box">Many <span class="font-bold">students prefer</span> online learning due to its flexibility and accessibility. (Not 'students prefers')</div>

                    <div class="example-box">Several <span class="font-bold">factors contribute</span> to climate change.</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Compound Subjects:</strong>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Joined by "and" usually take a plural verb.

                            <div class="example-box"><span class="font-bold">Education and healthcare are</span> considered vital sectors for national prosperity.</div>

                            <div class="example-box">Both <span class="font-bold">parents and children benefit</span> from family time.</div>

                        </li>

                        <li>Joined by "or" or "nor" agree with the subject closest to the verb. This is particularly important for clarity.

                            <div class="example-box">Neither the students nor the <span class="font-bold">teacher was</span> aware of the new policy. (Teacher is singular, closest to verb)</div>

                            <div class="example-box">Neither the teacher nor the <span class="font-bold">students were</span> prepared for the sudden change. (Students is plural, closest to verb)</div>

                        </li>

                    </ul>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Indefinite Pronouns:</strong> Words like 'each', 'every', 'either', 'neither', 'one', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'no one', 'somebody', 'nobody', 'something', 'nothing', 'anything' are singular and take a singular verb.

                    <div class="example-box"><span class="font-bold">Each of the proposals requires</span> careful consideration before implementation.</div>

                    <div class="example-box"><span class="font-bold">Everyone believes</span> that environmental protection is a shared responsibility.</div>

                    <div class="example-box"><span class="font-bold">Nothing seems</span> to deter the spread of misinformation.</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Collective Nouns:</strong> Can be singular or plural depending on whether the group acts as a single unit or as individuals. In IELTS, it's generally safer and more common to treat them as singular unless individual actions are clearly implied. Examples include 'government', 'committee', 'team', 'family', 'audience'.

                    <div class="example-box">The <span class="font-bold">committee has</span> reached a unanimous decision on the budget allocation. (Acting as a unit)</div>

                    <div class="example-box">The <span class="font-bold">staff are</span> debating among themselves about the new work schedule. (Acting as individuals - less common in formal IELTS, but grammatically correct)</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Phrases between Subject and Verb:</strong> Ignore intervening phrases (e.g., prepositional phrases, relative clauses, appositives) when determining agreement. The verb must agree with the *actual* subject, not a noun in the intervening phrase.

                    <div class="example-box">The <span class="font-bold">increase</span> in global temperatures, which has been observed over the last century, <span class="font-bold">is</span> alarming. (Subject is 'increase', not 'temperatures')</div>

                    <div class="example-box">The <span class="font-bold">challenges</span> faced by developing nations <span class="font-bold">are</span> complex and multifaceted. (Subject is 'challenges', not 'nations')</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Inverted Sentences:</strong> When the subject comes after the verb (e.g., with 'there is/are', 'here is/are', or in questions), ensure the verb still agrees with the true subject that follows it.

                    <div class="example-box">There <span class="font-bold">are</span> several <span class="font-bold">factors</span> contributing to this phenomenon. (Subject is 'factors')</div>

                    <div class="example-box">Among the various solutions <span class="font-bold">is</span> the <span class="font-bold">adoption</span> of renewable energy. (Subject is 'adoption')</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Quantifiers:</strong> Phrases like 'a number of', 'the number of', 'some', 'all', 'most'.

                    <ul>

                        <li>'<span class="font-bold">A number of</span>' (meaning 'many') takes a plural verb.

                            <div class="example-box"><span class="font-bold">A number of students have</span> enrolled in the program.</div>

                        </li>

                        <li>'<span class="font-bold">The number of</span>' takes a singular verb.

                            <div class="example-box"><span class="font-bold">The number of participants has</span> increased steadily.</div>

                        </li>

                        <li>'Some', 'all', 'most' take a singular verb if referring to a singular/uncountable noun, and a plural verb if referring to a plural noun.

                            <div class="example-box"><span class="font-bold">Most of the water is</span> polluted.</div>

                            <div class="example-box"><span class="font-bold">Most of the students are</span> aware.</div>

                <p class="font-bold">IELTS Tip:</p>

                <p>Subject-verb agreement is a fundamental aspect of grammatical accuracy. Examiners look for consistent control over this rule, especially in longer, more complex sentences. Always identify the true subject before deciding on the verb form. Errors here can significantly lower your score for Grammatical Range and Accuracy.

            <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">

                Articles are small but crucial words that specify whether a noun is definite or indefinite. Incorrect article usage is a frequent source of errors for non-native speakers and can detract from the clarity and precision of your writing. Mastering their use demonstrates a high level of grammatical control. English has three articles: 'a', 'an' (indefinite articles), and 'the' (definite article). Additionally, understanding when to use no article (the 'zero article') is equally important.

'An' is used before words that start with a vowel sound (a, e, i, o, u), and 'a' is used before words that start with a consonant sound. Remember, it's about the *sound*, not just the letter.

            <h3 class="sub-sub-section-heading">5.1. Types of Sentences:</h3>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Simple Sentence:</strong> Contains one independent clause (one subject and one verb).

                    <div class="example-box">Global temperatures <span class="font-bold">are rising</span>.</div>

                    <div class="example-box">The government <span class="font-bold">implemented</span> new policies.</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Compound Sentence:</strong> Contains two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (FANBOYS: For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So) or a semicolon.

                    <div class="example-box">Air pollution is a serious concern, <span class="font-bold">and</span> it affects public health significantly.</div>

                    <div class="example-box">Many people prefer public transport; <span class="font-bold">however</span>, car ownership remains popular.</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Complex Sentence:</strong> Contains one independent clause and one or more dependent clauses. Dependent clauses often begin with subordinating conjunctions (e.g., although, because, while, if, when, since, as, unless, whereas) or relative pronouns (e.g., who, which, that, whose, where, when, why).

                    <div class="example-box"><span class="font-bold">Although</span> technology offers numerous benefits, it also presents certain challenges.</div>

                    <div class="example-box">The report highlights the critical role <span class="font-bold">that</span> education plays in economic development.</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Compound-Complex Sentence:</strong> Contains two or more independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.

                    <div class="example-box"><span class="font-bold">While</span> some argue for stricter regulations, others believe in market-based solutions, <span class="font-bold">and</span> both perspectives have valid points.</div>

                Conditional sentences express cause and effect, hypothetical situations, or unreal conditions. They are vital for developing complex arguments in IELTS Writing Task 2, allowing you to discuss potential outcomes, consequences, or alternative scenarios. There are four main types of conditionals, plus mixed conditionals.

                <li><strong>Mixed Conditionals:</strong>

                    <p>Usage: Combine elements of different conditional types, typically when a past condition has a present result (Type 3 + Type 2) or a present condition has a past result (Type 2 + Type 3, less common).</p>

                    <p>Structure (Past condition, Present result): If + Past Perfect, Would + Base Verb</p>

                <p>Conditional sentences are excellent for demonstrating grammatical range. In Task 2, use them to present solutions, discuss potential consequences, or analyze past events. For example, when proposing solutions to a problem, you could use a first conditional: "If governments invest more in education, crime rates will likely decrease." For discussing hypothetical scenarios, a second conditional is effective: "If individuals were more aware of their carbon footprint, they would make more eco-friendly choices."</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">

                The passive voice is used when the focus is on the action or the recipient of the action rather than the performer of the action. It is particularly useful in academic writing, including IELTS Task 1 (describing processes, trends, or data where the agent is unknown or unimportant) and Task 2 (maintaining objectivity or focusing on the result of an action).

It is particularly useful in Task 1 for describing processes (e.g., "Water is filtered...") and in Task 2 for presenting general opinions or findings without attributing them to a specific person (e.g., "It is argued that..."). However, avoid overusing it, as it can make your writing less direct and engaging. A balance between active and passive voice is ideal.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">9. Relative Clauses</h2>

            <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">

                Relative clauses (also known as adjective clauses) provide additional information about a noun or pronoun. They are essential for forming complex sentences and demonstrating grammatical range in IELTS Writing. They begin with relative pronouns (who, whom, whose, which, that) or relative adverbs (where, when, why).

            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-sub-section-heading">9.1. Types of Relative Clauses:</h3>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Defining Relative Clauses:</strong> Provide essential information necessary to identify the noun. Without this clause, the meaning of the sentence would be unclear. No commas are used.

                    <div class="example-box">The student <span class="font-bold">who achieved the highest score</span> received a scholarship. (Identifies which student)</div>

                    <div class="example-box">This is the policy <span class="font-bold">that was implemented last year</span>. (Identifies which policy)</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Non-defining Relative Clauses:</strong> Provide extra, non-essential information about the noun. The sentence would still make sense without this clause. They are always separated by commas.

                    <div class="example-box">My brother, <span class="font-bold">who lives in Canada</span>, is visiting next month. (My brother is already identified; the clause adds extra info).</div>

                    <div class="example-box">The new report, <span class="font-bold">which was published yesterday</span>, highlights environmental concerns. (The report is already identified).</div>

                <li><span class="font-bold">Whom:</span> Refers to people (object). More formal, often replaced by 'who' in informal contexts.

                    <div class="example-box">The expert, <span class="font-bold">whom I interviewed</span>, provided valuable insights.</div>

                </li>

                <p>Prepositional errors are often subtle but can affect clarity. While there are rules, many prepositions are learned through exposure and memorization of common collocations. Pay attention to the prepositions used with common verbs (e.g., 'depend on', 'listen to', 'agree with/on/to'), adjectives ('responsible for', 'aware of'), and nouns ('impact on', 'demand for'). Reading widely and noting these patterns will significantly help.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">

                Gerunds (verb + -ing acting as a noun) and infinitives (to + base verb) are non-finite verb forms that can function as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs. Correctly using them demonstrates a sophisticated command of English grammar and allows for more varied and concise sentence structures.

            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-sub-section-heading">12.1. Gerunds:</h3>

            <p>A gerund is the -ing form of a verb used as a noun. It can be the subject of a sentence, the object of a verb, or the object of a preposition.</p>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>As Subject:</strong>

                    <div class="example-box"><span class="font-bold">Recycling</span> is crucial for environmental protection.</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>As Object of a Verb:</strong> Follows certain verbs (e.g., enjoy, finish, mind, avoid, consider, suggest, recommend, admit, deny, risk).

                    <div class="example-box">Many people <span class="font-bold">enjoy reading</span> books.</div>

                    <div class="example-box">The government <span class="font-bold">considered implementing</span> stricter laws.</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>As Object of a Preposition:</strong> Always follows a preposition.

                    <div class="example-box">They are interested <span class="font-bold">in promoting</span> sustainable development.</div>

                    <div class="example-box">He is responsible <span class="font-bold">for managing</span> the project.</div>

                </li>

            <h3 class="sub-sub-section-heading">12.2. Infinitives:</h3>

            <p>An infinitive is the base form of a verb preceded by 'to' (e.g., to go, to study). It can function as a noun, an adjective, or an adverb.</p>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>As Subject (less common in formal writing, often replaced by 'It is...'):</strong>

                    <div class="example-box"><span class="font-bold">To achieve</span> success requires dedication. (More common: It is important to achieve success.)</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>As Object of a Verb:</strong> Follows certain verbs (e.g., agree, decide, hope, plan, promise, refuse, want, wish, learn, manage, afford).

                    <div class="example-box">Governments <span class="font-bold">aim to reduce</span> carbon emissions.</div>

                    <div class="example-box">They <span class="font-bold">decided to implement</span> new policies.</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>To Express Purpose (as an adverb):</strong>

                    <div class="example-box">She studies hard <span class="font-bold">to pass</span> the exam.</div>

                    <div class="example-box">New measures were introduced <span class="font-bold">to improve</span> public safety.</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>After Adjectives:</strong>

                    <div class="example-box">It is difficult <span class="font-bold">to solve</span> this problem.</div>

                <p>Correctly using gerunds and infinitives adds to the grammatical range and accuracy of your writing. Pay close attention to the verbs and prepositions that precede them. A common strategy is to learn lists of verbs that are typically followed by gerunds (e.g., avoid, suggest) and those followed by infinitives (e.g., agree, decide). This will help you avoid common errors and write more naturally.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">

                Adjectives and adverbs are crucial for adding detail, precision, and descriptive power to your writing. While adjectives modify nouns and pronouns, adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Correctly distinguishing and using them enhances clarity and contributes to a higher lexical resource and grammatical range score.

            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-sub-section-heading">13.1. Adjectives:</h3>

            <p>Adjectives describe or modify nouns and pronouns. They answer questions like "which one?", "what kind?", or "how many?".</p>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Placement:</strong>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Before the noun they modify: <div class="example-box">a <span class="font-bold">significant</span> increase, <span class="font-bold">complex</span> problems.</div></li>

                        <li>After linking verbs (e.g., be, seem, appear, feel, look, sound, taste, smell, become): <div class="example-box">The situation <span class="font-bold">seems difficult</span>. The policy <span class="font-bold">is effective</span>.</div></li>

                    </ul>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Order of Adjectives:</strong> When multiple adjectives describe a noun, they generally follow a specific order (Opinion-Size-Age-Shape-Color-Origin-Material-Purpose Noun).

                    <div class="example-box">a <span class="font-bold">beautiful</span> <span class="font-bold">large</span> <span class="font-bold">old</span> <span class="font-bold">round</span> <span class="font-bold">brown</span> <span class="font-bold">wooden</span> table.</div>

            <h3 class="sub-sub-section-heading">13.2. Adverbs:</h3>

            <p>Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. They answer questions like "how?", "when?", "where?", "to what extent?", or "how often?". Many adverbs are formed by adding '-ly' to an adjective (e.g., quick -> quickly, careful -> carefully), but not all words ending in '-ly' are adverbs (e.g., friendly is an adjective). Some adverbs have the same form as their adjective (e.g., fast, hard, late, early).</p>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Types of Adverbs:</strong>

                    <ul>

                        <li><span class="font-bold">Adverbs of Place:</span> (where) <div class="example-box">Students study <span class="font-bold">here</span>. The problem exists <span class="font-bold">globally</span>.</div></li>

                        <li><span class="font-bold">Adverbs of Frequency:</span> (how often) <div class="example-box">Governments <span class="font-bold">often</span> implement new policies.</div></li>

                    </ul>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Placement of Adverbs:</strong> Depends on the type of adverb.

                    <ul>

                <p>Using a wide range of appropriate adjectives and adverbs can enhance both your lexical resource and grammatical range scores. Adverbs are particularly useful for expressing your stance (e.g., 'undoubtedly', 'arguably', 'significantly') or for describing trends in Task 1 (e.g., 'rapidly', 'gradually', 'steadily'). Ensure you understand the difference between adjectives and adverbs, especially for words that look similar.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">

                Comparatives and superlatives are forms of adjectives and adverbs used to compare two or more things. They are essential for describing trends, making comparisons in Task 1 (e.g., comparing data points), and presenting arguments in Task 2 (e.g., arguing which solution is 'better' or 'most effective').

            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-sub-section-heading">14.1. Comparative Forms:</h3>

            <p>Used to compare two things. Structure depends on the length of the adjective/adverb.</p>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Short Adjectives/Adverbs (1-2 syllables):</strong> Add '-er' (e.g., taller, faster, harder).

                    <div class="example-box">The new policy is <span class="font-bold">simpler</span> than the old one.</div>

                    <div class="example-box">Traffic moved <span class="font-bold">slower</span> today.</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Longer Adjectives/Adverbs (2+ syllables):</strong> Use 'more' (e.g., more important, more effectively).

                    <div class="example-box">Environmental issues are <span class="font-bold">more important</span> than ever.</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Irregular Forms:</strong> Some common adjectives/adverbs have irregular comparative forms.

            <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">

                While Coherence and Cohesion is a separate criterion in IELTS, grammatical elements play a significant role in achieving it. This section focuses on how grammatical structures contribute to the logical flow and connectivity of your ideas, helping your writing appear organized and easy to follow.

            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-sub-section-heading">15.1. Key Grammatical Elements for Cohesion:</h3>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Reference Devices (Pronouns, Demonstratives):</strong> Using pronouns (he, she, it, they, this, these, those) to refer back to previously mentioned nouns, avoiding repetition.

                    <div class="example-box">Many students face financial challenges. <span class="font-bold">They</span> often work part-time to support <span class="font-bold">themselves</span>.</div>

                    <div class="example-box">The government introduced a new policy. <span class="font-bold">This</span> measure aims to reduce unemployment.</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Substitution:</strong> Replacing a word or phrase with a simpler one to avoid repetition.

                    <div class="example-box">Some argue that online education is superior to traditional schooling. Others do <span class="font-bold">so</span> because of its flexibility. (Replacing 'argue that online education is superior to traditional schooling').</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Ellipsis:</strong> Omitting words or phrases when the meaning is clear from the context.

                    <div class="example-box">Some people prefer working from home; others do <span class="font-bold">not</span>. (Omitting 'prefer working from home').</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Conjunctions and Conjunctive Adverbs (Linking Words):</strong> Using appropriate linking words to show relationships between ideas (cause, effect, contrast, addition, sequence, etc.).

                    <ul>

                        <li><span class="font-bold">Addition:</span> Furthermore, Moreover, In addition, Additionally</li>

                        <li><span class="font-bold">Contrast:</span> However, Nevertheless, On the other hand, In contrast, Although, While</li>

                        <li><span class="font-bold">Cause/Effect:</span> Therefore, Consequently, As a result, Due to, Since, Because</li>

                        <li><span class="font-bold">Example:</span> For example, For instance, Such as, To illustrate</li>

                        <li><span class="font-bold">Summary/Conclusion:</span> In conclusion, To summarize, Overall, In essence</li>

                    </ul>

                    <div class="example-box">The cost of living has increased significantly. <span class="font-bold">Consequently</span>, many families struggle financially.</div>

                    <div class="example-box"><span class="font-bold">Although</span> public transport is efficient, many still prefer private cars.</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Parallelism:</strong> Using similar grammatical structures for similar ideas (covered in detail in the next section). This creates balance and readability.

                    <div class="example-box">The policy aims <span class="font-bold">to reduce crime</span>, <span class="font-bold">to improve education</span>, and <span class="font-bold">to boost the economy</span>.</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Tense Consistency:</strong> Maintaining consistent tenses within a paragraph or section unless there is a clear reason for a shift. This ensures a clear timeline.

                    <div class="example-box">The chart <span class="font-bold">shows</span> a decline in sales from 2000 to 2005, and then the figure <span class="font-bold">recovered</span> slightly by 2010. (Consistent past tense for past data).</div>

                <p class="font-bold">IELTS Tip:</p>

                <p>While coherence and cohesion are about the logical flow of ideas, grammatical tools are essential for achieving this. Use a variety of reference devices and linking words to connect your sentences and paragraphs smoothly. Practice using complex sentences with appropriate conjunctions and relative clauses to show relationships between ideas, rather than just listing them. This will make your essay much easier to follow and more persuasive.</p>

        <section id="parallelism" class="mb-8">

            <h2 class="section-heading">16. Parallelism</h2>

            <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">

                Parallelism (also known as parallel structure) is the repetition of a chosen grammatical form within a sentence or a series of sentences. By making sure that phrases or clauses are grammatically similar, you create a sense of balance, rhythm, and clarity in your writing. This is particularly important for lists, comparisons, and compound structures.

            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-sub-section-heading">16.1. Principles of Parallelism:</h3>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>In Lists:</strong> All items in a list should have the same grammatical form (e.g., all nouns, all gerunds, all infinitives, all clauses).

                    <div class="example-box">The responsibilities of the government include <span class="font-bold">providing education</span>, <span class="font-bold">ensuring healthcare</span>, and <span class="font-bold">maintaining security</span>. (All gerunds)</div>

                    <div class="example-box">Students benefit from activities that are <span class="font-bold">engaging</span>, <span class="font-bold">interactive</span>, and <span class="font-bold">educational</span>. (All adjectives)</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>In Comparisons:</strong> The elements being compared should be grammatically parallel.

                    <div class="example-box">Working from home is often <span class="font-bold">more flexible than working</span> in an office. (Gerund phrase vs. gerund phrase)</div>

                    <div class="example-box">The cost of living in the city is higher <span class="font-bold">than that in rural areas</span>. (Noun phrase vs. noun phrase)</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>With Correlative Conjunctions:</strong> When using pairs like 'either...or', 'neither...nor', 'not only...but also', 'both...and', the grammatical structure following each part of the conjunction should be parallel.

                    <div class="example-box">The new policy aims <span class="font-bold">not only to reduce crime but also to improve public safety</span>. (Both are infinitive phrases)</div>

                    <div class="example-box">Students should consider <span class="font-bold">either studying abroad or gaining work experience</span>. (Both are gerund phrases)</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>In Clauses:</strong> When connecting clauses, ensure their structure is parallel.

                    <div class="example-box">The report highlighted <span class="font-bold">what caused the problem</span> and <span class="font-bold">how it could be solved</span>. (Both are noun clauses)</div>

            <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">

                Inversion is a grammatical structure where the usual order of subject and verb is reversed, often for emphasis or to create a more formal or dramatic tone. While not always necessary, strategic use of inversion can demonstrate a high level of grammatical control and add variety to your sentence structures in IELTS Writing Task 2.

            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-sub-section-heading">17.1. Common Uses of Inversion:</h3>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>After Negative Adverbials:</strong> When a negative adverbial phrase (e.g., rarely, seldom, never, hardly, scarcely, no sooner, not only, little, under no circumstances) starts a sentence, the auxiliary verb comes before the subject.

                    <div class="example-box"><span class="font-bold">Never before have</span> we witnessed such rapid technological advancements.</div>

                    <div class="example-box"><span class="font-bold">Not only does</span> education empower individuals, <span class="font-bold">but it also</span> fosters economic growth.</div>

            <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">

                The subjunctive mood is used to express wishes, suggestions, demands, or hypothetical situations that are contrary to fact. While less common in everyday English, its correct use in formal or academic writing, particularly in IELTS Task 2, can demonstrate a sophisticated command of grammar.

            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-sub-section-heading">18.1. Uses of the Subjunctive Mood:</h3>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>After Verbs of Suggestion, Demand, Recommendation, Request, Importance:</strong> Used in 'that' clauses following verbs such as 'suggest', 'recommend', 'demand', 'insist', 'propose', 'request', 'advise', 'urge', 'require', 'order', 'ask'. The verb in the 'that' clause is in its base form (without 's' for third person singular) and does not change for tense.

                    <div class="example-box">It is essential that the government <span class="font-bold">take</span> immediate action. (Not 'takes')</div>

                    <div class="example-box">We recommend that he <span class="font-bold">be</span> present at the meeting. (Not 'is')</div>

                    <div class="example-box">They insisted that the project <span class="font-bold">be completed</span> by Friday.</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>After Impersonal Expressions of Importance/Necessity:</strong> Used after expressions like 'it is vital that', 'it is important that', 'it is crucial that', 'it is necessary that'.

                    <div class="example-box">It is crucial that public funds <span class="font-bold">be allocated</span> efficiently.</div>

                    <div class="example-box">It is necessary that every citizen <span class="font-bold">understand</span> their rights.</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>In Hypothetical Situations (with 'wish' or 'if only'):</strong> To express a wish or a hypothetical situation that is contrary to present reality.

                    <div class="example-box">I wish I <span class="font-bold">were</span> able to solve this problem. (Not 'was')</div>

                    <div class="example-box">If only he <span class="font-bold">were</span> here to see this.</div>

                </li>

            <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">

                Participle clauses are non-finite clauses that begin with a present participle (-ing form), a past participle (-ed form), or a perfect participle (having + past participle). They are used to shorten sentences, combine ideas, and add detail, demonstrating a sophisticated grammatical range in IELTS Writing. They typically describe an action that happens at the same time as, or immediately before, the main clause's action.

                </li>

                <li><strong>Past Participle Clauses (-ed):</strong> Used when the participle clause has a passive meaning, and the subject is the same as the main clause.

                    <div class="example-box"><span class="font-bold">Motivated by the desire for change</span>, the public demanded reforms. (The public was motivated)</div>

                    <div class="example-box"><span class="font-bold">Published in 2023</span>, the report highlights key environmental trends. (The report was published)</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Perfect Participle Clauses (Having + Past Participle):</strong> Used when the action in the participle clause happened before the action in the main clause, and the subject is the same.

                    <div class="example-box"><span class="font-bold">Having completed the research</span>, the scientists presented their findings. (First they completed, then they presented)</div>

            <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">

                Nominalization is the process of forming a noun from a verb or an adjective. It is a common feature of formal and academic writing, allowing writers to express complex ideas concisely and objectively. While overuse can make writing dense, strategic nominalization can enhance the academic tone and grammatical sophistication of your IELTS essays.

            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-sub-section-heading">20.1. How Nominalization Works:</h3>

            <p>It involves transforming verbs or adjectives into nouns, often with suffixes like -tion, -ment, -ance, -ence, -al, -sis, -ity, -ness.</p>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Verb to Noun:</strong>

                    <ul>

                        <li><span class="font-bold">Verb:</span> The government <span class="font-bold">decided</span> to implement new policies.</li>

                        <li><span class="font-bold">Nominalization:</span> The <span class="font-bold">decision</span> to implement new policies was made by the government.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <ul>

                        <li><span class="font-bold">Verb:</span> Companies <span class="font-bold">produce</span> goods.</li>

                        <li><span class="font-bold">Nominalization:</span> The <span class="font-bold">production</span> of goods is increasing.</li>

                    </ul>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Adjective to Noun:</strong>

                    <ul>

                        <li><span class="font-bold">Adjective:</span> The issue is <span class="font-bold">important</span>.</li>

                        <li><span class="font-bold">Nominalization:</span> The <span class="font-bold">importance</span> of the issue cannot be overstated.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <ul>

                        <li><span class="font-bold">Adjective:</span> The economy is <span class="font-bold">stable</span>.</li>

            <h3 class="sub-sub-section-heading">20.2. Benefits in IELTS Writing:</h3>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Conciseness:</strong> It can condense information, making sentences more compact.

                    <div class="example-box">Instead of: "When people consume too much sugar, it leads to health problems." <br> Use: "<span class="font-bold">Excessive sugar consumption</span> leads to health problems."</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Formality and Objectivity:</strong> Nominalized forms often sound more formal and objective, suitable for academic writing.

                    <div class="example-box">Instead of: "I believe that governments should intervene." <br> Use: "<span class="font-bold">Government intervention</span> is often considered necessary."</div>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Focus on Concepts:</strong> It shifts the focus from the actor/action to the concept itself.

                    <div class="example-box">Instead of: "Scientists researched the phenomenon." <br> Use: "<span class="font-bold">Research</span> into the phenomenon was conducted by scientists."</div>
